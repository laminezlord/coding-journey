Section A

1. What is a computer? (Input–Process–Output)
A computer is an electronic device that receives input, processes the data, and produces output.
Example:

Input: typing numbers

Process: calculating

Output: showing the answer on the screen

2. Why a computer is not only a laptop/desktop (3 examples)
A computer is any device that takes input, processes it, and gives output.
Examples:

ATM – input: card & PIN, process: bank transaction, output: cash/receipt

Smart TV – input: remote control, process: apps/videos, output: display & sound

Washing Machine – input: buttons, process: wash program, output: clean clothes

3. Is a smartphone a computer?
Yes, a smartphone is a computer.

Input: touchscreen, microphone, camera

Output: screen, speaker

Processing unit: CPU inside the phone

Storage: internal memory (ROM, storage card)

Section B

4. What is a computer system?
A computer system is a complete set of components that work together to perform tasks.

Hardware: phone, keyboard

Software: Android, Windows

Data: photos, documents

Users: people using the device

5. Role of the CPU (“brain” of the computer)
The CPU processes all instructions and controls other parts of the computer.
It is called the brain because it thinks, decides, and controls operations.

6. RAM vs Storage (real-life analogy)

RAM: temporary memory (like the table you work on)

Storage: permanent memory (like a cupboard)

RAM is fast and clears when power is off.
Storage keeps data even when power is off.

7a. Hardware without software
The computer will not work. It is just useless parts.

7b. Software without hardware
The software cannot run. It is just ideas without a machine.

Section C: Software and Programs

8. What is software?
Software is a set of programs that tell the computer what to do.
It is essential because hardware cannot work by itself.

9. What is a program? (Tea example)
A program is a set of instructions to perform a task.

Plain English program to make tea:

Boil water

Put tea bag in cup

Pour hot water

Add sugar and milk

Stir and drink

10. “Fast but stupid”
Computers are fast at processing but cannot think.
They only do exactly what the programmer tells them to do.

Section D: Programming and Languages

11. What is programming?
Programming is writing instructions for a computer to follow.
Using a computer is just operating software made by others.

12. Early programming & why inefficient
Early computers were programmed using machine language and switches.
It was slow, error-prone, and hard to understand.

13. Machine language
Machine language is binary (0s and 1s).
It is difficult because humans do not easily understand binary numbers.

14. Assembly language
Assembly uses simple words like ADD and MOV instead of 0s and 1s.
It made programming easier than machine language but still hardware-dependent.

Section E: High-Level Languages, Compilers, Interpreters

16. High-level languages
High-level languages are human-friendly languages like Python and JavaScript.
They were developed to make programming easier and faster.

17. Comparison

Feature	Machine	Assembly	High-Level
Readability	Very poor	Poor	Easy
Ease of use	Very hard	Hard	Easy
Hardware dependent	Yes	Yes	No

19. Compiler (analogy)
A compiler translates the whole program at once before running.
Analogy: translating a whole book before reading it.

20. Interpreter
An interpreter translates and runs the program line by line.
Difference: Compiler translates everything first, interpreter works line by line.

21. JavaScript as interpreted
JavaScript runs line by line in the browser.
This means it runs immediately without full compilation first.

Section F: Evolution & Big Picture

22. Evolution of programming languages
Programming moved from machine language → assembly → high-level languages like C, Java, Python, JavaScript.

23. Why languages evolve (2 reasons)

To make coding easier for humans

To handle new technology and devices

Section G: Software Engineering

24. What is engineering?
Engineering is solving problems using planning and design.
It is different from trial-and-error because it follows a structured approach.

25. Software engineering & importance
Software engineering is building software using proper methods and planning.
It is important for large systems to avoid failure and errors.

Difference:

Software development: writing programs

Software engineering: planning, designing, testing, maintaining large systems

Example:
A small calculator app = development
A banking system = software engineering

Section H: Critical Thinking

26. World without software
Phones, banks, hospitals, and transport would stop working.
Daily life would become slow and manual.

27. Devices becoming computers
I agree. Phones, cars, TVs, and even fridges now use software to work.

28. Who is responsible when software fails?
The programmer is responsible because the computer only follows instructions.

Section I: Practical Observation

29. Example: Smartphone

Input: touch, voice

Processing: CPU

Output: screen, speaker

Software: Android, apps

30. Three daily software apps

WhatsApp – communication

Google Chrome – browsing

Calculator – calculations
